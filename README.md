# WUXC Projects

This is the GitHub for any WUXC projects we want to work on this summer or our time moving forward. 

Been waiting to do this for quite some time. Bored after work so starting to brainstorm stuff that we could do. It's honestly a great way to get used to the git flow as well (make branches, commit often, etc... I still need to get better at this for work/life)

# Possible Projects (Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, etc...)

- Remake Logarun
	- Would probably be a longer project...
	- Full Stack project here, would require one of us to get an AWS instance (or use AWS Lambda, pretty genious stuff tbh)
	- More JS and HTML/CSS/SCSS than Python/Java
	- I second this project (Pratyay) I would like to work on my JS and backend skills. 

- WUXC Pokemon
	- Idek how we would do this, would probably have to go through Unity or something (C# I believe?)
	- Graphics would be the hardest thing for us to do, not sure if any of us have any experience with animations/graphics but I (Zac, Pratyay) certainly don't
	- Also a longer project, lots of paths that it could take
	- Pratyay: would be a huge learning opportunity but a lot of it would be learning and not doing so might be long and slow

- 131 Projects
	- Would be interesting to convert everything (or a lot of it) into Python or some other language. 
	- Wouldn't really have any payoff other than the possibility that it could be used if people ever wanted something to practice on/with
	- Cytron has already dumped a gross amount of time into Java packages/projects for the students, so I'm not sure how long it would take to replicate things (StdDraw, for example)
	- Pratyay: This would be interesting and a good way to improve Python. 

- NotARobot / LogARun Data
	- Would be hella willing to open up the source code to what I've built so far
	- Might be a little confusing since it's a jumbled codebase, I/we would have to go back through and refactor everything
	- It's all in Python thank lanta, but also not sure how much further the project could be taken. There is a lot of data that could be pulled/displayed in cool ways
	- Data Science side of this is probably more interesting, NLP/NLG stuff isn't quite there yet

- Something else WUSTL related
	- Anything to give back, I guess. Cliche, but would be cool to build something that either the team or the school could end up using
	- Some app that would show which study rooms are open? Not even sure if this is possible, already see a lot of potential problems with this if it isn't official with the school
	- Something that would offer class suggestions based on filters? Would have to hook into webstac somehow...
	- Tutor/Study Guide app? Would generate guides based on what classes/sections you needed

- Fux around elsewhere
	- Honestly this would be fun just to bounce ideas off of each other
	- Wouldn't mind if this ended up being a place for peer code reviews when there isn't anyone else to go to
	- Imma convert whatever you guys put up here into Python regardless
